The chapter re-order tool is for when you have a audiobook with a number written alphabetically instead of numerically, eg: Chapter Thirty-One - Warbreaker - Brandon Sanderson.
The script assigns a numerical value to the chapter and re-names the file, this is so file explorer or another file app can automatically sort it into the correct order.
The other tool just removes changes made by the chapter re-order tool.
